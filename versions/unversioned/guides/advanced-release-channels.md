> **WARNING:** Channel features are in beta, run `npm install -g exp` to get the most up to date features.

## Introduction

For a quick introduction to release channels, read [this] (https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/release-channels.html).

When you publish your app by running `exp publish --release-channel staging`, it creates:

- a release, identified by a `publicationId` for Android and iOS platforms. A release refers to your bundled source code and assets at the time of publication. 
- a link to the release in the `staging` channel, identified by a `channelId`. This is like a commit on a git branch.

For simplicity, the rest of this article will refer to just the `ios` releases, but you could swap out ios for android at any point and everything would still be true.

## See past publishes
You can see everything that youâ€™ve published with `exp publish:history`. 

#### Example command and output
`exp publish:history --platform ios`

| publishedTime  | appVersion  | sdkVersion  | platform  | channel  | channelId  | publicationId  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2018-01-05T23:55:04.603Z  |  1.0.0 | 24.0.0 |  ios | staging  | 9133d577  | d9bd6b80  |

To see more details about this particular release, you can run `exp publish:details`

#### Example command and output
`exp publish:details --publish-id d9bd6b80`

## What version of the app will my users get?

Your users will get the most recent compatible release that was pushed to a channel. Factors that affect compatibility:

- sdkVersion
- platform

The following flowchart shows how we determine which release to return to a user:

## Promoting a release to a new channel

Example use case: you previously published a release to `staging` and everything went well in your testing. Now you want this release to be active in another channel (ie) production

We run `exp publish:set` to push our release to the `production` channel. 
`exp publish:set --publish-id d9bd6b80 --release-channel production`

Continuing from the previous section, we can see that our release is available in both the `staging` and the `production` channels.

`exp publish:history --platform ios`

| publishedTime  | appVersion  | sdkVersion  | platform  | channel  | channelId  | publicationId  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2018-01-05T23:55:04.603Z  |  1.0.0 | 24.0.0 |  ios | staging  | 9133d577  | d9bd6b80  |
| 2018-01-05T23:55:04.603Z  |  1.0.0 | 24.0.0 |  ios | production  | 6e406223  | d9bd6b80  |

## Rollback a channel entry 

Example use case: you published a release to your `production` channel, only to realize that it includes a major regression for some of your users, so you want to revert back to the previous version.

Continuing from the previous section, we rollback our `production` channel entry with `exp publish:rollback`.

`exp publish:rollback --channel-id 6e406223`

Now we can see that our release is no longer available in the production channel.

`exp publish:history --platform ios`

| publishedTime  | appVersion  | sdkVersion  | platform  | channel  | channelId  | publicationId  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2018-01-05T23:55:04.603Z  |  1.0.0 | 24.0.0 |  ios | staging  | 9133d577  | d9bd6b80  |
